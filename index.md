# Projects

### Laravel Famework
#### Small Start Up

I use Laravel for most of the Full stack projects I work on, I use it for its ability to build out a large website in a short manner of time and know it has built in Security, I like how easy it is to use Models/Eloquent for easy access to the Database tables.

Project that I have built using Laravel Framework 
A client wanted an ecommerce store to list and sell his art using Paypal and Stripe, I chose to use Laravel as it would allow me to quickly built the site using the built in Authentication system after that using the Blade view engine and the routing engine, I built an easy to use ecommerce store with a Admin panel for him to view his orders and where he needs to ship them to along with an overview of his sales

### Lumen Framework
#### Medium sized food ordering platform

I tend to use Lumen web a client is looking for a Rest API, I find using routes when making a Rest API is great because when writing Documentation its easy for the client to rerefer to the routes.php file and get an easy understanding of the structure of the API  

Project that I have built using Lumen Framework 
A client wanted an ecommerce payment API, that allowed him to easily accept payments via Paypal, Stripe, Bitcoin(Coinbase), WorldPay and Payza.
I setup so he would send a request to create a transaction it would return a transaction ID along with a JWT token that would be valid for an amount of time he would chose and all the enabled Payment methods and the buyer would select the payment method and complete the purchase and get returned a receipt ID and be sent an email confirming the purchase.

### Git & Jenkins 

I find that using Git makes it easier to manage my projects and versions, there for I normally setup a development branch along with a Deployment Branch, its useful when working with a team of people so everyone can see who has changed something and see why it was updated

Jenkins is also really good to use along with Git because I can set it up to run my PHP tests units every time something is committed to my Deployment branch on git and if all test units are passed it would automatically push that code to the Production server for all of the users to use and if any Test units fail, I can immediately fix the issue and a commit the fix to the Deployment branch
